Pseudocode for Word-Guessing GameCreate a Game class.
	* Game class has 3 states: answer, guess and solution.
	* Create a reader method for answer, and an accessor method for 	guess.Store 1st user input (word or phrase - String) as word to guess.Check 2nd user input against stored 1st user input.	* When checking 2nd user input against stored 1st user input, update a counter variable to keep track of how many checks (“guesses”) have been attempted/made.	* Guesses are limited, so perform the checks in a loop for as many times allowed as determined by the number of guesses allowed.		* The number of guesses allowed is related to the length of the word - so make the number of guesses allowed equal to the length of the word.	* Check that the 2nd user input has not been repeated - if it has, do not update the guess counter.		* To check this, store all 2nd user inputs in an array and check that there are no instances of the 2nd user input in the array.If the 2nd user knows how many guesses are available, it is because in the beginning there are equal number guesses as letters in the word to guess.	* After each check against the 2nd user’s input, so long as it is not a repeat (as defined above), compare the letter placements of the word to guess with the 2nd user if the words do not match.	* Provide updates on the word to guess based on correct letter placement from the 2nd user input using the solution state.Print a congratulatory statement to the user if the word is guessed in the given amount of tries, and a taunting message if the word is not guessed in the given amount of tries.Methods to be defined:
* initialize class
* check if guess is correct
* compare guess to answer for similarities
* check if game is over and print appropriate result
