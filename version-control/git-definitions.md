# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a Git system that records changes made to files/set of files over time so that it is easier to recall previous versions. It is useful because it saves previous work that can be referred back to if need be.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a context or sub-category that can be merged to the master branch. There can be many branches but not all need to be merged to the master (you can also un-merge branches). You would use branches to inventory certain aspects/features of the master branch. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit can be considered a moment/action in the directory that is being recorded. Git commit messages, especially good ones, would thoroughly detail a change that has been made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when there are multiple changes being made to a branch and Git cannot resolve how to integrate new changes.
